# SWF to Phaser
By far the easiest open source SWF exporter.

This project was prototyped pretty fast, feel free to contribute a cleanup.

## Requirements
- [Java \(8 or newer\)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases?version=8)
- [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) (alternatively any other texture packer with CLI)

## Getting started
To run swf-to-phaser, simply run the `run.bat` or `run.sh` files.\
See this video for a quick tutorial:\

## Compiling
To compile swf-to-phaser, you need Maven - use the `package` lifecycle.\
The compiled JAR file isn't enough - check out the file structure on the releases tab.

## TODOs:
- Ability to get all assets (without packing bigger ones as one asset)
- Button animations (missing JPEXS feature?)

## Extra thanks
Apart from people already mentioned in the code, also thanks to [Ubuntu Community](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting), StackOverflow, [AskUbuntu](https://askubuntu.com/a/108260), Edu14463 (for testing), everyone at CPAB and Google in general. I know it sounds obvious, but why not thank anyways.
